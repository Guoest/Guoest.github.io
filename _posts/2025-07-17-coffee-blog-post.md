## Introduction

What if I told you I built a fully functional payment platform in a single afternoon?

Not a mockup. Not a prototype. A real, working website that processes actual payments, manages user accounts, and is live right now at [coffee.beyondintelligence.dev](https://coffee.beyondintelligence.dev).

**The kicker? I barely wrote any code myself.**

## The AI Development Revolution Is Here

Remember when building a payment platform meant:
- Weeks of backend development
- Complex authentication systems
- Payment integration nightmares
- Endless debugging sessions

That was last year. Today, I'm shipping production-ready apps in hours, not months.

My secret weapons:
- **[Lovable](https://lovable.dev?via=yicheng)** - An AI that writes entire applications from plain English
- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/)** - Backend infrastructure in minutes
- **[Stripe](https://stripe.com)** - Payments without the pain

## See It In Action

Before I show you how to build your own, check out what I built:

**[‚òï coffee.beyondintelligence.dev](https://coffee.beyondintelligence.dev)**

{% include image.html src="/images/coffee-blog/demo.gif" alt="Coffee site demo" caption="The live site in action" class="screenshot" %}

The site offers a clean, modern way to support creators:

üöÄ **What I Built:**
- ‚úÖ **Passwordless magic link auth** - Just enter your email, click the link, and you're logged in!
- ‚úÖ **Choose your support style:**
  - Quick one-time coffees ($3, $5, or $10)
  - Monthly/weekly subscriptions for ongoing support
- ‚úÖ **Subscription management** - Dashboard to manage your plans
- ‚úÖ **Global currency support** - Automatically detects and accepts your local currency
- ‚úÖ **Beautiful, polished UI** - Looks like it took months, built in hours
- ‚úÖ **Perfect mobile experience** - Try it on your phone!


## How the Magic Happened

Here's where it gets really interesting. I didn't just jump into Lovable - I used ChatGPT to optimise my approach first.

**Step 1: ChatGPT as My Architect**

I asked ChatGPT: "Help me create a buy me a coffee site with Lovable, following their prompting best practise"

ChatGPT generated:
- A complete knowledge base file with project specs
- Database schemas
- API documentation
- Step-by-step prompting strategy
- Even colour palettes and design guidelines!

{% include image.html src="/images/coffee-blog/chatgpt-planning.png" alt="ChatGPT planning output" caption="ChatGPT's comprehensive project blueprint" class="screenshot" %}

**Time spent: 10 minutes** ‚è±Ô∏è

**Step 2: The Quick Parts - UI & Deployment**

With ChatGPT's blueprint, Lovable flew through the basics:

- **UI Generation:** Beautiful interface with Tailwind CSS
- **Component Structure:** React components for everything
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach
- **Deployment:** One-click publish with Lovable's hosting

This part was shockingly fast. The AI understood the design requirements and created a polished interface immediately.

{% include image.html src="/images/coffee-blog/ui-generation.png" alt="AI-generated UI" caption="From prompt to polished interface in minutes" %}

**Time spent: 1 hour** ‚è±Ô∏è

**Step 3: The Security Reality Check (80% of my time!)**

Here's the truth nobody talks about: **AI generates prototype code, not production code.**

In the early versions, Lovable suggested:
1. Email-only auth (no verification!)
2. Then email + simple password (still insecure)
3. Handling payment data locally (huge liability!)

**I spent 5 hours identifying and fixing security issues:**

- **Authentication:** Rejected AI's initial suggestions, implemented passwordless magic links
- **Payment Security:** Delegated ALL payment handling to Stripe (we store zero payment data)
- **Database Security:** Configured Row Level Security, prevented SQL injection
- **Infrastructure:** Enforced HTTPS everywhere
- **Data Architecture:** Single `customers` table linking to Stripe customer IDs

The beautiful part? Lovable generated all the secure code once I knew what to ask for:
- Supabase edge functions for payment processing
- Stripe webhook handlers
- Subscription management endpoints
- Secure API routes

I didn't write the code - but I had to know what secure code looks like.

**Time spent: 5 hours** ‚è±Ô∏è (reviewing, testing, hardening)

**Step 4: Final Testing & Polish**

The last phase - making sure everything actually works:
- End-to-end payment testing in sandbox
- Mobile responsiveness checks
- Error handling improvements

**Time spent: 30 minutes** ‚è±Ô∏è

## Real Talk: My Results

Let me share the raw numbers:

{% include image.html src="/images/coffee-blog/time-breakdown.png" alt="Development time breakdown" caption="Where the 6.5 hours actually went" %}

- **Total development time:** 6.5 hours
- **Step 1 - Planning (ChatGPT):** 10 minutes
- **Step 2 - UI & Deployment:** 1 hour
- **Step 3 - Security hardening:** 5 hours (77% of project!)
- **Step 4 - Testing & polish:** 30 minutes
- **Lines of code I personally wrote:** 0 (zero!)
- **Lines of code generated by AI:** ~2,000+
- **Security flaws caught and fixed:** 7+
- **Supabase edge functions created:** 4
- **Monthly running cost:** $0 (free tiers)


## Your Turn: Build Your Own Payment Platform This Weekend

I'm going to show you EXACTLY how to build your own version. No gatekeeping, no "figure it out yourself" - just pure, actionable steps.

### Why start with a payment platform?
Because it's the ultimate validation tool. Here's the secret:

- Ideas are worthless until someone pays for them
- The fastest way to test any business? See if people will pay
- Whether it's a course, service, or product - payment validates demand
- Skip surveys and waitlists - get real commitment with real money

What you can validate:

- Creators: Will people support your content?
- Consultants: Will clients pay for your expertise?
- Builders: Will users buy your product?
- Anyone: Will your idea make money?

Once someone pays, you deliver the value and boom - you've validated your business model in a weekend.

**The best part?** Lovable handles everything - from code generation to hosting. You don't even need to know what GitHub is.

### üöÄ Step 1: Get Your Tools Ready

**1. Sign up for Lovable** 
- Go to [Lovable](https://lovable.dev?via=yicheng) (yes, this is my referral link - it helps me create more content like this!)
- Start with the free trial
- You'll need this to generate your app

**2. Create a Supabase account**
- Head to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- Free tier is perfect for starting
- Note your project name and Lovable will handle integration

**3. Set up Stripe**
- Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
- You need to follow the steps to do ID verification if you want to receive payments
- Start in test mode (no real money)
- Grab your test API keys

‚úÖ **Checkpoint:** You should have 3 browser tabs open with your new accounts

### üß† Step 1.5: Use ChatGPT to Optimize Your Approach

Before diving into Lovable, get ChatGPT to help you plan:

**ChatGPT Prompt:**
```
I want to build a [your idea] website using Lovable (an AI code generator). 
Can you:
1. Create a knowledge base file with project specifications
2. Generate optimised prompts for Lovable
3. Include database schema and API structure
4. Suggest design guidelines

Make it production-ready with authentication and payments.
```

ChatGPT will give you:
- A complete project blueprint
- Step-by-step Lovable prompts
- Technical specifications
- Design system

**Pro tip:** This AI-to-AI handoff is the secret sauce!

### üöÄ Step 2: Generate Your App with Lovable 

First, add your ChatGPT-generated knowledge base to Lovable's [Knowledge File section](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/knowledge).

Then use these refined prompts (or the ones ChatGPT created for you):

**Initial Build Prompt:**
```
Use the knowledge file. Build a responsive landing page for "Support My Work". 

Page should include:
- A hero section with a personal message
- One-time donation buttons ($3, $5, $10)
- Recurring donation toggle (weekly/monthly) 
- Social media links (Twitter, GitHub, LinkedIn, website)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Warm, coffeehouse aesthetic with Tailwind CSS
```

After each prompt:
1. Test in preview mode
2. Refine with specific requests
3. Watch the magic happen!

### üöÄ Step 3: Connect Your Backend 

Time to make it real with Supabase - and Lovable makes this ridiculously easy:

**The Magic Integration:**
1. Click the Supabase integration button in Lovable
2. Follow the connection wizard
3. Lovable automatically creates your database!

**What Lovable Sets Up For You:**
```sql
create table customers (
  id uuid references auth.users primary key,
  stripe_customer_id text unique,
  email text unique,
  created_at timestamp default now()
);

-- That's it! Stripe handles everything else
```

**Tell Lovable What You Want:**
```
Connect to Supabase with:
- Passwordless magic link authentication
- Edge functions for payment processing
- Secure API routes with RLS enabled
- Webhook handlers for Stripe events
```

Lovable will:
- Configure your Supabase project
- Set up authentication flows
- Create edge functions for payments
- Enable all security features

**No manual SQL needed!** Just click, connect, and let Lovable handle the technical setup.

### üöÄ Step 4: Make Money with Stripe 

This is where your site becomes real - and it's simpler than you think:

**Just One Key Needed:**
1. Get your Stripe secret key from the dashboard
2. Add it to Lovable's environment variables such as `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret` (don't just paste plain text)
3. That's it!

**Stripe Integration Prompts for Lovable:**
```
Add Stripe payment processing with:
- One-time coffee purchases ($3, $5, $10)
- Monthly subscription tiers ($5, $10, $20)
- Auto-detect user currency and convert prices
- Customer portal for subscription management
- Beautiful checkout experience with loading states
- Supabase edge functions to handle all payment logic
```

**The Magic of Edge Functions:**
Lovable generates Supabase edge functions that handle everything:
- Payment creation
- Subscription management
- Customer portal access
- Payment verification


**Test the flow:**
- Use card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Any future date and CVC
- Watch the magic happen! ‚ú®

**Pro tip:** Start in Stripe test mode, verify everything works, then flip to live mode when ready.

### üöÄ Step 5: Deploy and Get Your First Coffee

**The Easiest Deploy Ever:**

Lovable makes deployment ridiculously simple:
1. Click the "Publish" button in Lovable
2. Your site is instantly live! üéâ
3. Optional: Link your custom domain with one click (like I did with [coffee.beyondintelligence.dev](https://coffee.beyondintelligence.dev/))

That's it. No GitHub, no build commands, no server setup.


**Launch Checklist:**
- ‚úÖ Test payment flow end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Check mobile responsiveness
- ‚úÖ Switch Stripe to live mode
- ‚úÖ Share with friends for first coffee!
