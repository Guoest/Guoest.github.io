## Project Overview

During the 2023 Christmas break, I dove into the fascinating world of image processing and came up with something exciting: my first machine learning model on Hugging Face, a Room Classifier! It can tell the type of room by looking at an image.

## Technical Details

This nifty tool uses the fastai library's resnet model to identify room types from photos, a neat trick for anyone in real estate or tech, or just anyone who loves exploring new technology. It's a step in my journey into deep learning, guided by the insightful [Fastai Course](https://course.fast.ai/).

Why is this cool? It blends AI with real estate, offering a glimpse into the future of home visualization.

Can't wait to see what you think. Here's to more tech adventures! ðŸš€ðŸ’«
